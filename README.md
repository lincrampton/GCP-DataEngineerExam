# GCP-DataEngineerExam
My experience studying for (and passing!) the GCP Data Engineer exam

1) Suggestions on how to study:
Beats me.  The test was hard and nothing I did fully prepared me properly for it.  Based on suggestions of others, what I did was:  

a) Courses:  I read that the LinuxAcademy course was useful, as were the Coursera courses.  Both sites were a good introduction, but neither went into the depth of the exam.  I wouldn't have passed the exam by simply understanding the materials in these courses, but they were a good jump-off point.

b) Questions dumps:  Went through the questions on Udemy and Whizlab.  Didn't see a single question on the exam that I took that remotely resembled the questions provided in the dumps.  Like the courses mentioned above, these were a good jumping-off point. Preferred Whizlab's quiz format -- single question followed by the answer as well as pointers to Google docs.  

c) Google's own training sites, e.g., https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/.  This is the only site I studied that directly helped me answer an exam question.  Plus the material presented here is clear and somewhat entertaining.

2) When are exam results returned?
For me, it was the next business day.  Took the exam at 11am Friday and got an email on Monday night.  I sort of expected to receive my results immediately, since it was a computer based exam and every passing hour without results led me to a greater certainty that I had failed the exam.
